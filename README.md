Edit: this will no longer be updated as the latest skytils update from a few days ago added this feature for p5 statues (ig use this if you want all falling entities disabled)

*FULLY OPEN SOURCE*


*Information*

Small mod to help reduce lag and stop game freezes,
Stops you from rending falling block entities to help with lag in skyblock (mainly phase 5 of m7 with the statues exploding and the dragon in the end spawning) 
Can be toggled with a keybind that you can set in Minecraft controls. 
Shouldn't break anything besides possibly midas staff and yeti sword.

*HOW TO DOWNLOAD*

https://github.com/JerryRune/JerryRune-Addons/releases/tag/1.0.2

Currently working on making it togglable in a gui instead of a keybind.
